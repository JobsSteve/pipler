Pipler - original prototype

This is original prototype of my new puzzle game [Pipler](http://pipler.in)

I've made this prototype just in 4-5 hours to check how is it interesting to play this mechanics

But final game I've made on [Defold engine](http://defold.com/) because want to try new language(lua) and participate in [Defold gamesjam (RU)](http://gamesjam.org/events/26/)


Hope you will find and see how unity is important in early prototyping. 
And surely you will enjoy [Final game](http://pipler.in)



p.s. in this game i've used [DataBind](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/28301), if you don't have this package you can just remove dataModel stuff and you just wont have counting
